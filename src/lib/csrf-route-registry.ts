/**
 * Single source of truth for CSRF coverage on mutating API routes.
 *
 * Issue #563 — every non-GET handler must call verifyCsrf(request) so
 * browser sessions (cookie auth) are protected. Machine-to-machine callers
 * using Authorization: Bearer / X-API-Key bypass CSRF inside verifyCsrf().
 *
 * Keep this registry in sync with docs/CSRF-AUDIT.md and the enforcement
 * tests in src/__tests__/csrf-coverage.test.ts.
 *
 * Two lists, and the drift guard in the test suite treats them as the union
 * that must account for every mutating handler on disk:
 *   • MUTATING_ROUTES      — browser-reachable handlers that call verifyCsrf.
 *   • CSRF_EXEMPT_ROUTES   — machine-invoked handlers that authenticate with a
 *                            shared secret instead of a CSRF token. Each one
 *                            needs a written reason.
